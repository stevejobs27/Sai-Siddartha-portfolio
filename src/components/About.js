              Hi, my name is Rafsan and I enjoy fiddling with numbers and solving problems. My interest in data started back in 2022 when I was working on a market research report for a startup.
              The subtle realization of the power of data was all it took to get me hooked on the field of data analytics. 
          </p>
          
          <p ref={el => textRefs.current[1] = el}>
            Since then, I’ve earned a <a href= "https://www.credly.com/badges/76531ad7-80dc-4eea-8523-983d8b70f941/public_url" target="_blank">Google Data Analytics Certificate</a> and built a strong foundation in <span className="highlight">SQL, Tableau, and Python</span>.   For me, data analysis feels like playing detective—piecing together clues from numbers to reveal the bigger picture.
          </p>
          
          <p ref={el => textRefs.current[2] = el}>
            I have a strong appetite for learning and I'm always eager to explore new technologies. This website is a testament to my journey where I picked up <span className="highlight">HTML, CSS & JavaScript</span> along the way. I also have a background in <span className="highlight"> Graphic Design. </span>
          </p>
          
          <p ref={el => textRefs.current[3] = el}>
            Outside of work, I love playing video games. I'm also into aesthetic interior designs and I love hoarding cool tech products.
